# Computer-vision-transfer-learning-model-using-EfficientNetB0-as-Base-Model-
This project presents the development of a computer vision model in Tensorflow using transfer learning with base model EfficientNetB0 and fine tuning. The model achieved 80% validation accuracy compared to 70% presented in Food vision paper

- This model utilizes mixed precision to enhance the training speed (Mixed precision means the switching between float16 and float32 in model training and storing of weights)

**Tensorflow Datasets**
- Tensor flow datasets will be used to download the foodvision 101 dataset which contains 101 classes of food data.
